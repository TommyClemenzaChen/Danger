# DANGER: A Danger Awareness Neural Generative Extension Framework for Robustness test
We have released the DANGER Dataset publicly to aid the research community in making advancements in model robustness and explainability.

The DANGER framework is universal to many opensource dataset. In this repo we provided two datasets - the vKITTI1 add-on dataset and the vKITTI2 add-on dataset.

## To Do

- [x] Calculate `u,v` 
- [ ] Verify `u,v`  by check each operation in `vkitti_edit_benchmark.json`
- [ ] Try generate `*.json` by generate `delete` operation
- [ ] Try generate `*.json` by generate `ry` operation
- [ ] Try generate `*.json` by change `u,v` operation
